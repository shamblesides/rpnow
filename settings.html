  <h3>🌐 Add Webhook</h3>
  <p>
    It's extremely easy to make a bot on your <a href="https://discordapp.com/" target="_blank">Discord</a> server
    that messages one of your channels any time a new message is posted.
    <a href="https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks" target="_blank">
      This guide shows how to generate a webhook URL in Discord.
    </a>
    Once you've done that, paste that URL below.
  </p>
  <p>
    (If you want to stop using the webhook, simply delete it in Discord.)

  <form action="api/webhook" method="POST">
    <input name="webhook" type="text" placeholder="Paste URL Here" required>
    <button type="submit">Add</button>

  <h3>🔍 Audit Logins</h3>
  <p>
    The server records whenever anyone tries to enter a passphrase to access the RP, whether or not they
    were successful. If you're worried about someone being here that's not supposed to be, this is how
    you check.
