MAYBE: VIEW LAYER
-----------------
create vendor folder for www deps (search project for jsdelivr) (make sure to add them to prefetch!)
web component version of color picker
move all side-effects out of vue layer
convert vue to superfine + (some state management, possibly effector)
though also consider preact bundled with htm: unpkg.com/htm/preact/standalone.module.js (iOS9 supports class{} !)
or: zero dep option: insertAdjacentHTML / outerHTML. Combine with templating for safe user strings (Mustache.js? or custom)
we may not even need to parse HTML if we just do document.querySelector('template').content.cloneNode(true) (downside: how to use template on multiple pages?? maybe: just do a SPA) (but that's hard!!!)
(remember that .querySelector is actually on all html elements!!!)
