<p>Hello,</p>
<p>You probably came here looking for an RP from the old version of
  RPNow. This old version of RPNow was shut down in July 2019,
  <a href="https://blog.rpnow.net/post/179967000616/whats-happening-to-rpnownet">
  as was announced in November 2018 in this post.</a>
  If you did not download your RP between that time, it 
  is unfortunately no longer accessible.</p>
<p>The good news is that RPNow is back, and you can use it again, and
  create new RP's. It works somewhat differently now: instead of saving
  bookmarked links to your stories, you now can view all of the RP's you
  have created on the homepage of the site. As a consequence of this,
  the site can no longer be used without creating a login (although
  we still do not require any personal information from you.)</p>
<p><a href="/">Go back to the homepage and enjoy using the site.</a></p>
<p>Have a nice day.</p>
<p>&mdash; Nigel</p>
